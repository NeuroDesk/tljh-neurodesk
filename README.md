# tljh-datascience

This plugin installs Docker and DockerSpawner on your server, and then tells TLJH to use DockerSpawner to select the [jupyter/datascience-notebook](https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) image as the environment for each user. This makes it easy to include R and Julia Kernels for your JupyterHub users.

It also:
- Sets jupyterlab as the default
- Installs the jupyterlab git add on
